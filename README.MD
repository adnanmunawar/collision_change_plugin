Simple plugin to change the scaling of the collision shape after its launched.


To build:
``` bash
cd <this_path>
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run:

```
ambf_simulator -a <this_path>/ADF/sphere.yaml
```

The plugin will change the collison of one of the sphere constantly. It should jumpy around in the simulation.
